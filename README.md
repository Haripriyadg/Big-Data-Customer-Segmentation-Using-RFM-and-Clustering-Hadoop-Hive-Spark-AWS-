# Big-Data-Customer-Segmentation-Using-RFM-and-Clustering-Hadoop-Hive-Spark-AWS-

E-commerce companies generate vast amounts of semi-structured data. To derive value from it, this project leverages a cloud-native big data stack—AWS S3, Hadoop, Hive, Spark, and SageMaker—for scalable storage, preprocessing, analytics, clustering, and visualization.

Preprocessing & Storage: Clean and structure raw retail transaction data using Hive and Hadoop. Store it on AWS S3 for scalable access.

Analysis & Segmentation: Use Spark MLlib to perform customer segmentation using RFM metrics.

Visualization: Present insights using Python’s matplotlib and seaborn in JupyterLab via SageMaker.
